# THANOS

THANOS is a sequence model which captures the two level hierarchy within a document. The first is word level hierarchy and the second is the sentence level hierarchy. The THANOS architecture consists of a tree-LSTM based word level encoder in order to obtain embedding for each sentence in the dataset, a GRU based sentence level encoder and a sentence-level attention layer.
